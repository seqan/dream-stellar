# Downloads the file to <build>/data/downloaded.fasta

# Some ways to obtain the checksum:
#
#   wget --quiet -O- https://ftp.seqan.de/app-template/downloaded.fasta | sha256sum
#   c3cb990ca1a25c7e31be3c6c2d009238d9ac9a44b2b7c143753c1e2881699077  -

# You can also use curl:
#   curl --silent https://ftp.seqan.de/app-template/downloaded.fasta | sha256sum

# If you have the file locally, you can use `sha256sum` directly:
